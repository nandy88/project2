### Planning

The objective of this project was to build my first full-stack database backed application. To demonstrate this, I chose to build a simple app where users could answer a series of questions and be assigned a hero based on their answers.

My original planning for this project consisted of mocking up some wireframes on paper and then outlining what routes my users would take as they worked their way through the site. I also created a to do list of items I had to complete as I made my way through the build but deviated heavily from that towards the final day of work as it became clear that what I envisioned would cause me to exceed my timeframe for completion.

### Technologies Used

### Ruby & Sinatra, CSS, SQL

### Ruby & Sinatra

I began the project by first setting up my routes and drafting a few of the methods which would be required to pull the data from the SQL datatbase I later set up. I would probably revese the order of completion with these next time as determining what information I required proved more challenging and my routes also required modification later also, so I believe I wasted some time here. 

After the amount of content we have covered in class about RUBY and Sinatra, I feel quite confident in how to use RUBY itself but my understanding of methods/functions and the data values returned clearly need some more work. As for Sinatra and having RESTful routes, I have understood an implemented most but have failed to implement the use of the PATCH method. I also feel I am still not using tools such as the app_console and pry frequently enough and trying to work everthing out in my head. This is definately and area I will be focusing on moving forward as it will help greatly in understanding and addressing issues I am running into during the course of development.

### SQL

The use of SQL for creating and requesting information from databases is something I feel quite confident with. The syntax is simple enough and for the purpose of building this app, it was very easy to use. As mentioned before however, I have learnt that I need to pay attention to what values are being returned when i call upon the information.

### CSS

For the purpose od completing this project in a timely manner, I did not spend of time on CSS but it is a feature of web development which i will definately need to research and practice more. Visual representation and creativity is certainly an area I would like to better myself in moving forward.

### Most Imporatnt Lesson

Rather that rushing into development, I need to refine my approach to solving a problem. During the course of this project I understood that I had all the tools I required to complete this but wasn't thinking about how to use them. I feel with better planning, I will increase my attention to detail and be able to come up with solutions more readily.
